## Peer Review: Brett's Regression Model Project

**Brett's Project Notebook:** [ML Final Project Juptyer Notebook](https://github.com/bncodes19/ml-regression-neely/blob/main/regression_neely.ipynb)

### Strengths
- The notebook is well-structured, with clearly labeled sections for data exploration, feature engineering, and model comparison.
- Brett provides a thoughtful explanation of performance metrics (R², MAE, MSE, RMSE) and compares the baseline linear model with the pipeline model effectively.
- The reflection sections are strong and show a good understanding of model interpretation, especially regarding error metrics and feature impact (e.g., the inclusion of BMI and children).
- Code is clean and readable, and the pipeline implementation was a nice touch to scale numeric features and streamline preprocessing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Consider adding **visualizations** (like residual plots or scatter plots of actual vs predicted charges) to give a clearer picture of model fit.
- The justification for dropping or including specific features (e.g., why region wasn't used) could be briefly discussed.
- It might be helpful to wrap key metric comparisons in a DataFrame to enhance readability instead of relying solely on printed outputs.

### Final Thoughts
This notebook does a great job walking through the modeling process and comparing alternatives. The pipeline approach with `StandardScaler` shows improved performance in R² and RMSE, supporting the final reflection that it was the better model overall. With a few added visualizations and expanded feature justification, this would be an excellent end-to-end regression analysis notebook.
